I'm Andy, a high school student and developer from New York, NY. The majority of my repos here as of right now are from my high school computer science classes, although I do have a few side projects here. I usually program in Swift and Java, although I also have experience programming in C, C#, Python, Luau (Roblox's fork of Lua).
